# Conway-s-Game-of-Life

This was my first interation of conways game of life that is understandably slow, however, based on assignment credentials we needed to use a two dimensional array
and adhere to the rules of Conway's game of life which are below.

RULES: 
If the cell is alive, then it stays alive if it has either 2 or 3 live neighbors. If the cell is dead, then it springs to life only in the case that it has 3 
live neighbors.
